    ## Insights
    - Most items that have high purchased amounts in 2022 have low ratings, while those same clothes have lower puchased amounts in 2023 and have higher ratings.
    - One of those exceptions, was a Tunic which still had a higher purchase amount in 2022 and 2023.
    - The reverse happened with clothes that had less people buy in 2022, but more people bought in 2023 and those clothes in 2022 had lower ratings than the ones in 2023. That was still consistent.
    - More customers used credit cards then cash.
    - The average spending method by each customer was credit cards.
    - More people purchased clothes with cash than credit cards.
